# PressKey
A little programm to simulate keystrokes using input-parameters for Elgato Stream Deck



[DOWNLOAD SERVER/CLIENT](https://github.com/Jonn3y/PressKey/releases/download/v1.0/PressKeyv1.0.exe.zip)



# HowToUse

1. Start Server -  you can move it to the autostart-folder (there will nothing happen. The server runs in background without any GUI)
  
2. Create "Open"-Shurtcut on Elgato Stream Deck:

App:File/ "C:\Path\To The\Client.exe" parm1 parm2 !parm3 
![Stream Deck](https://github.com/Jonn3y/PressKey/blob/master/PressKeyElgato.JPG)

3. click where you want.
4. Press your Key on Elgato Stream Deck
5. Be happy :)


It's based on german keyboad-layout. I did not test it with other layouts!
